# SonarProject
The dataset under study is a storic dataset used by Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988) in their “Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets” in Neural Networks, Vol. 1, pp. 75–89.
As the name suggests, the aim of this project is to use the data provided by a sonar to distinguish between rocks and metal objects such as mines. 
The dataset is made of 60 features (strenght of bouncing signals at 60 different angles) with 208 observations.

In the [Exploring_the_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/anmancuso/SonarProject/blob/main/Exploring_the_Dataset.ipynb) notebook, the data are visualized with box plots to check the precesence of possible outliers and to understand the general trend of the data.
