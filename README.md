# SonarProject
The dataset under study is a storic dataset used by Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988) in their “Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets” in Neural Networks, Vol. 1, pp. 75–89.
As the name suggests, the aim of this project is to use the data provided by a sonar to distinguish between rocks and metal objects such as mines. 
The dataset is made of 60 features (strenght of bouncing signals at 60 different angles) with 208 observations.
